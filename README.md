# OutputKit
For making nicer looking Shortcuts

OutputKit is a bit of JSON (a dictionary in the form of text) that contains the markup for [Bootstrap CSS Components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/), you put into a variable at the start of your Shortcut. You can then refer to the different elements with tags in a variable in your Shortcut.

## OutputKit Getting Started
It's best to look at the [OutputKit Examples](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1219) Shortcut to get an idea of how it works, then to start with the [OutputKit Template](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1220) to start making your own. Once you have a better idea, you can create you're own html templates, or update to the latest set of tags using the [OutputKit Build](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1221) Shortcut.

## How to set tags
Shown here is choosing the variable you've assigned the OutputKit json to, and entering the corresponding key/OutputKit tag.
