# OutputKit
For making nicer looking Shortcuts


OutputKit is a bit of JSON (a dictionary in the form of text) that contains the markup for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/)  componnents, you put into a variable at the start of your Shortcut. 

## Getting Started

### Getting started with the template.
To get started its best to take the Template Shortcut and just start a shortcut from there.
If youre adding it your own Shortcut youve already made, you will probably want to use Builder to add tags and a html template to your Shortcut.

### Adding to your Shortcut
Once youve done that you can then refer to the different elements with the tags listed below. It's best to look at the .

### How to set tags
Shown here is choosing the variable you've assigned the OutputKit jshttps://casual-effects.com/markdeep/latest/apidoc.css?on to, and entering the corresponding key/OutputKit tag.

### Types of tags

- Menu Lists
- Web Components

## Menu Lists
These are for creating lists containing pictures which can then be used like a menu to make a selection. It's important that they all remain on the same line (although it will of course wrap on the screen) with no carraige returns between them. All tags must be used, ie even if not using the Subtitle. 

It's often useful to put any images/sounds and other big/reused items in dictionary at the top of your shortcut, and it keeps the text window clear of long strings.

### The tags

- (ml)Title(mlsub)Subtitle(mlimage)base64encoded(/ml) 

Title is the Main title of the list item
Subtitle is the smaller black lettering underneath the Title of the list menu item. 


ml
mlsub
mlimage
mlnote
/ml

### Using in a Shortcut


#### Additional actions to add to your Shortcut
Add the actions below to display the list menu in your Shortcut

Text (Paste in the menu you created in Menu Builder)
Set Name : Menu.vcf
Get Variable : Set Name (Use a magic variable to point to set name action above, and then select and change the type to contact)
Choose From List

#### After a selection is made
If you are using the listmenu to make menus of options you will likely have to use IF Otherwise actions.

#### Retrieving Values
You can get the variable of the selection, then set the variable as a contact if not already set, then set to NAME to retrieve the Title selected, or COMPANY for the subtitle selected.

get image from site, and edit text below fo rcontext

#### Advanced
You can store additional information in VCARDS in other fields used by the CARDS for example if the menu had colour names in the Name field, you could have RGB/HEX values in other fields that you dont want displayed, but you want to retrieve later.

A text editor is essential if you want to re-order/remove or change the cards, some text editors will have a reorganise function that automatically identifies blocks of text and lets you drag/drop them into new orders.

If you end up just typing/copy pasting your own in Shortcuts, having all your images in one dictionary at the beginning is a neat way to organise your Shortcut.

## Web Components


### Bars

Bars are simple percentage lines. The first number you put is the text displayed, the second one inside the tags is the number used to work out what is shown.

### Tables
The table tag will make your table responsive, ie works better on mobile screens of variable sizes. You wont need the normal table html tag, you can use the thead tbody th tr html mark up to make your table, or you can use Markdown to generate your table first. If you're just making a static table you might find [this site](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables) useful. 

- table    /table


### Media
- Images imgb64  /imgb64

## Shortcuts
- [OutputKit Examples](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1219) Shortcut to get an idea of how it works, then to start with the 
- [OutputKit Template](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1220) to start making your own. Once you have a better idea, you can create you're own html templates, or update to the latest set of tags using the 
- [OutputKit Build](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1221) Shortcut


## Depreceated 

- Topbar You now use the template builder to decide on if/when to have the space.
No longer in the tags
- viewport - sets up the page
- bootstrapminimal - for including the bootstrap files
- webapp - for when creating a page with no address bar, eg like a home screen launcher
- topbarspace - adds space needed for a navbar
- fa:icon - The includes for Font Awesome icons
- md:icon - The includes for Material Design
- disableselection - Disables selection of text in the web page
- disablezoom - Disables zooming of web page
