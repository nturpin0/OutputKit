# OutputKit
For making nicer looking Shortcuts

Intro here 
OutputKit is a bit of JSON (a dictionary in the form of text) that contains the markup for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/)  componnents, you put into a variable at the start of your Shortcut. 


## OutputKit Shortcuts
- [OutputKit Examples](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1219) Shortcut to get an idea of how it works, then to start with the 
- [OutputKit Template](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1220) to start making your own. Once you have a better idea, you can create you're own html templates, or update to the latest set of tags using the 
- [OutputKit Build](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1221) Shortcut

## OutputKit Getting Started

### Getting started with the template.
To get started its best to take the Template Shortcut and just start a shortcut from there.
If youre adding it your own Shortcut youve already made, you will probably want to use Builder to add tags and a html template to your Shortcut.

### Adding to your Shortcut
Once youve done that you can then refer to the different elements with the tags listed below. It's best to look at the .

### How to set tags
Shown here is choosing the variable you've assigned the OutputKit jshttps://casual-effects.com/markdeep/latest/apidoc.css?on to, and entering the corresponding key/OutputKit tag.

## Components

### Menu Lists
These are for creating lists containing pictures which can then be used like a menu to make a selection. It's important that they all remain on the same line (although it will of course wrap on the screen) with no carraige returns between them. All tags must be used, ie even if not using the Subtitle. 



You might notice that another dictionary item is used Media. It's sometimes a good idea to have a dictionary at the beginning of your Shortcut contatining a dictionary with any media items like an image, or sounds at the beginning of your Shortcut.

- ml   mlsub   mlimage(required even if not using.  /ml.

### Bars
- bar /bar
Bars are simple percentage lines. The first number you put is the text displayed, the second one inside the tags is the number used to work out what is shown.

### Tables
The table tag will make your table responsive, ie works better on mobile screens of variable sizes. You wont need the normal table html tag, you can use the thead tbody th tr html mark up to make your table, or you can use Markdown to generate your table first. If you're just making a static table you might find [this site](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables) useful.
