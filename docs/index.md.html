**Example page!** This is example page of the API doc style created [Aras Pranckevičius](https://github.com/aras-p) at Unity for Morgan McGuire's [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) and now part of the official Markdeep distro. It uses content that could be an imaginary documentation page. Here would be some introduction text. ## What is this? **Thing** is a thing used to do stuff for various platforms. Some of the things it can do: * Run on a computer * Exit with an exit code * Be a replacement for our old system, `theoldthing.exe` ## Invoking it
This is a note by the way! 
From the root folder, run "thing" with the target name, e.g.: `thing Yes` * On Mac, Linux or Windows PowerShell, you'll want to use `./thing` instead of just `thing`. * Target and option names are case sensitive! * Several things to do can be specified: `thing Yes No FileNotFound` Additional options can be passed via `-sNAME=VALUE` arguments. Most common ones are CONFIG (used to indicate debug or release thing) and PLATFORM (used to indicate 32 vs 64 bit thing). ### Subsection on stuff Thing Name | Description |Notes ------------------------|--------------------|----- Yes | Yup! | No | Nope :( | FileNotFound | Doesn't find files | Pass `-sFIND_FILE=maybe` to maybe find them ## Markdeep syntax test Regular styling like **bold**, _italics_, ~~strikethrough~~, `inline code`, the stuff. * A * Bullet * List And: 1. A 1. Numbered 1. List! Symbol substitutions: a 45-degree turn; som x -> y arrows; some whoa ==> fancy <==> arrows. Is this a definition list? : Looks like one to me Is that right? : Possibly! And a code listing: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ int main() { return 1; } ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Markdeep diagrams: ******************************************* Here's a text to the right of the diagram, * +-----------------+ .-. * ain't that fancy. Pretty fancy indeed, I * |\ | .-+ | * must say! Markdeep diagrams are generally * | \ A-B *---+--> .--+ '--. * enclosed into a rectangle full made of `*` * | \ | | Cloud! | * symbols; and are "drawn" using ASCII-art * +---+-------------+ '-------------' * style, with `- | + / \ * o` etc. ******************************************* Suh-weet! Another random diagram, just because: ******************** * +-+-+-+-*-o * * / / ^ / * * / v / / * * +-+-+-+ * ********************
