## [/u/matthewr_1987](https://www.reddit.com/user/matthewr_1987) 
for using suggesting tags and using OutputKit in his [Powr](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1430) Shortcut, and all the promotion/support, and to 


## [/u/ROPit](https://www.reddit.com/user/ROPit) 
for sorting out my logo. ROPit also makes [MediaKit](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1911) take a look, (its nothing to do with OutputKit) but helps you "Showcase your Shortcuts like a Pro".
